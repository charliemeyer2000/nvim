# Charlie's Neovim Config.

This is my second attempt at a Neovim configuration. The first time, I basically just made a vscode clone which was just not good at all. It was slow, buggy, and quite frankly it is against hte "ethos" of what neovim is about (in my opinion) - focus, speed, configurability, and not a gui.

This is better. this is more maintainable and significantly more lightweight.

I'm now using AI coding assistants less and less. I'm only using claude code now mostly for small implementations + understanding new codebases. I'm frustrated by how Cursor and other AI editors are invasive and I actually feel stupider using them. This is a return to the basics.
